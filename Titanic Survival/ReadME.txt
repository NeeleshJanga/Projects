Problem:
# The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
# While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
# In this challenge, we are asked to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

My Solution:
#The results I got were pretty interesting with an accuracy of 94.98% with Logistic Regression, 79.67% with Random Forest Classifier & 64.83% with SVM.
